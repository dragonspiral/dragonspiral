hello! I'm solis <img src="https://barbara.crd.co/assets/images/gallery28/a639e43a.gif?v=115e6ed7">, (or fiygons, or pokemaster28.. I don't care what you call me really) I use they/them, but friends can use he/him if they so wish ^\_^

I like pokemon!! <img src="https://barbara.crd.co/assets/images/gallery05/770177fc.gif"><img src="https://barbara.crd.co/assets/images/gallery05/a1c9e904.gif"> (specifically gameverse and speverse. I have not watched the anime in 3 million years and I do not intend to catch up anytime soon)
I'm one of those people who actually like pokemon for the story. wow. crazy. <img src="https://barbara.crd.co/assets/images/gallery27/4d0157d1.gif">

<img src="https://barbara.crd.co/assets/images/gallery15/e504d2bd.gif"> dni if you fit <a href="listography.com/dni">basic dni</a> or if youre antirecovery. interact at your own discretion if you like friday night funkin, helluva boss/hazbin hotel, or dsmp. I cannot stop you from interacting, but I will most likely dislike you. sorry. I have multiple ships I am uncomfortable with, and I will simply hide you if I see it. I hide very liberally, if I hide you it is not personal I promise

apparently I have to state this but if I've hidden you then thats the end of it. don't try to bypass with an alt or sic your friends on me seriously what is going through your mind
